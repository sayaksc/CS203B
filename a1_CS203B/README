Problem Statement:

1. Recruitment Problem
Google USA is going to visit IITK to hire the best qualified (good algorithmic and programming skills)
student in his/her final year. There are n applicants and n is obviously really huge since Google USA is
offering a huge salary. The following are the constraints:
Constraints
  1. The interview panel will select only one applicant and the selection will be based totally on his/her
  qualifications which can be revealed only after the interview of the applicant.
  2. The placement office of IITK has enforced that each applicant should be informed about his/her
  selection or rejection immediately after the interview.

Assumptions
  1. The qualification score of each person, revealed through interview, is a distinct number. You may
  assume it to be a real number in the interval (0,1). Alternatively, you may assume it to be a distinct
  integer in a sufficiently large range.
  2. The applicants appear for interview in a uniformly random order (Each permutation is equally likely).
  Considering the contraints and the assumptions stated above, the interview panel of Google USA has devised
  the following strategy.

The strategy
  Fix a number k < n. Interview and reject first k applicants. After that continue conducting the interviews,
  and stop as soon as we find an applicant better than the first k applicants. If we dont find any applicant
  better than the first k applicants, then no one is hired.

Dependencies for code:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
